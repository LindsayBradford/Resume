  \begin{Achievements}
   \Achievement{Proved via empirical analysis the viability of a prototype Web 
         Application Server capable of accepting and incorporating nearly 
         unrestricted software changes at runtime, and under extreme load. 
         This resulted in a published PhD thesis, three peer-reviewed articles, 
         two instances of national media coverage, and one patent.}
    \Achievement{Original author of the YAWLEditor, a workflow editor, allowing users 
          to quickly draw, validate and analyse YAWL workflow definitions. 
          Contributed to efforts showing that executable business processes could 
          be successfully applied to the highly creative domain of Film and Television.}
    \Achievement{Over a 7.5 year period, contributed in a number of increasingly 
          more senior roles to taking market share of the Shares Settlement 
          System from a handful of Brisbane Stockbrokers to over half of the 
          60-odd Australian Stockbroker community.}
