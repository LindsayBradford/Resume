A simple LaTeX resume generation environemnt, based on Perl scripts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

With /raw as the working directory, run the CookPDF.pl perl script 
to generate a PDF of the resume source LaTeX file in the same directory.

The resultant resume.pdf will be placed in the /cooked directory.

The LaTeX environment this has been tested with is the TexLive distribution
supplied with Ubuntu 11.10. The following packages are probably needed
to get the LaTeX to generate with fault:

TexLive: Essential programs and files
TexLive: LaTeX Basic Packages
TexLive: LaTeX Recommended Packages
TexLive: LaTeX Supplementary Packages
TexLive: LaTeX Auxiliary Packages
TexLive: MetaPost (and MetaFont) Drawing Packages
TexLive: Extra Fonts
